BB\ (Single- or Multi-Process Optimization over Networks) Version 4.0 is a
powerful environment for implementing custom branch, cut, and price
algorithms. The subroutines in the \BB\ library comprise a state-of-the-art
MIP solver designed to be modular and easy to customize for various problem
settings. All internal library subroutines are generic---their implementation
does not depend on the the problem-setting. As of Version 4.0, SYMPHONY works
out of the box as a generic MIP solver, with the capability to read both MPS
files and AMPL files and solve the described mixed integer programs. To
customize SYMPHONY, various user subroutines can be written and parameters
set that modify the default behavior of the algorithm. The API for these
subroutines is described in this manual and files containing function stubs
are provided. As an example, by modifying the default I/O subroutine, one can
easily modify the solver so that it reads in problem instances in a custom
format (such as the TSPLIB format for specifying traveling salesman problem
instances).

The vast majority of the computation takes place within a ``black box,'' of
which the user need have no knowledge. \BB\ performs all the normal functions
of branch and cut---tree management, LP solution, cut pool management, as well
as inter-process or inter-thread communication. \BB\ can be built in a variety
of configurations, ranging from fully parallel to completely sequential,
depending on the user's needs. The library runs serially on almost any
platform, and can also run in parallel in either a fully distributed
environment (network of workstations) or shared-memory environment simply by
changing a few options in the makefile. To run in a distributed environment,
the user must have installed {\em
\htmladdnormallink{Parallel Virtual Machine}{http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/}}
(PVM) software, available for free from Oak Ridge National Laboratories
\begin{latexonly}
at {\tt http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/} 
\end{latexonly}. 
To run in a shared memory environment, the user must have installed an
OpenMP compliant compiler. A cross-platform compiler called {\em
\htmladdnormallink{Omni}{http://pdplab.trc.rwcp.or.jp/Omni}}, which uses 
{\tt cc} or {\tt gcc} as a back end, is available for free download
\begin{latexonly}
at {\tt http://pdplab.trc.rwcp.or.jp/Omni}.
\end{latexonly}.

New in Version 4.0 is the extensive use of the
\emph{\htmladdnormallink{COIN}{http://www.coin-or.org}}
optimization libraries 
\begin{latexonly} 
COIN optimization libraries,
available from \texttt{http://www.coin-or.org} 
\end{latexonly}.
SYMPHONY now uses COIN's OSI to interface with most commonly available LP
solvers. Generic cuts are now generated using COIN's Cut Generator Library
(CGL) and the COIN LP Solver (CLP) can be used through the OSI to solve the LP
relaxations. The COIN MPS reader is used to read in MIP instances in MPS
format. For a summary of what else is new, see Section \ref{whats-new}. The
improvements have required a number of changes to the API. Code written for
previous versions of SYMPHONY will be broken, but not too badly. Instructions
for porting from previous version are contained in the file
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/README-4.0}.

This section of the manual is concerned with the detailed
specifications needed to develop an application using \BB. It is
assumed that the user has already read the first part of the manual, which
provides a high-level introduction to parallel branch, cut, and price
and the overall design and use of \BB.

\subsection{Compiling the Sample Application with Unix Operating Systems}
\label{getting_started_unix}

Here is a sketch outline of how to get started with SYMPHONY in Unix. This is
basically the same information contained in the README file that comes with
the distribution and will lead you through the steps required to compile
SYMPHONY as a generic MIP solver that can then be customized by filling out
the functions provided in the user interface files. Because SYMPHONY is
intended to run over nonhomogeneous networks of workstations, installation is
not fully automated, but requires the user to make minor edits to the
Makefile.  With this setup, compilation for multiple architectures and
configurations can be performed in a single directory without reconfiguring or
"cleaning". This is convenient on nonhomogeneous networks, but it means that
you might need to edit the Makefiles to get SYMPHONY to compile. For the casual
user, this editing is limited to providing some path names.

\subsubsection{Preparing for Sample Compilation.}

\begin{itemize}

        \item Download the file {\tt SYMPHONY-4.0.tgz}.

        \item Unpack the distribution with ``{\tt tar -xzf
        SYMPHONY-4.0.tgz}''. This will create a subdirectory called
        {\tt SYMPHONY-4.0/} containing the distribution.
        
        \item Edit the makefile ({\tt SYMPHONY-4.0/Makefile}) to reflect your
              environment. This involves specifying the LP solver to be used
              and the paths to various libraries and include files. Only minor
              edits should be required. An explanation of what has to be set
              is contained in the comments in the Makefile. 

        \item To use many of the new capabilities of SYMPHONY, you must have
	      installed the
	      \emph{\htmladdnormallink{COIN}{http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/}}
	      optimization libraries 
	      \begin{latexonly} 
	      COIN optimization libraries, available from 
	      \texttt{http://www.coin-or.org}
	      \end{latexonly}. 
	      Specifically, you should install OSI, CGL, and
	      the Coin utilities (in the COIN/Coin directory). If you want to
	      use the COIN LP solver, you should also download CLP. These can
	      be downloaded from www.coin-or.org. The path to the COIN
	      libraries must be specified in \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/Makefile}.

        \item If you wish to read AMPL files, you will have to install the Gnu
	      Linear Programming Kit (GLPK), which contains a parser for AMPL
	      files. The path to the GLPK libraries must be specified in
	      \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/Makefile}.

\end{itemize}
        
\subsubsection{Compiling the Sequential Version.}

\begin{itemize}
        \item Change to the \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory and type
``\texttt{ make}''. This will first make the
\BB\ library (sequential version). After making the \BB\ library, make will
compile the user customization library and link the executable. The name of
the executable is specified in the file \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/Makefile}
and is ``\texttt{mip}'' by default. The executable is installed in the directory
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/bin.\$(ARCH)/\$(LP\_SOLVER)}, where \texttt{ARCH} is 
the current architecture and \texttt{LP\_SOLVER} is the current LP solver, as 
specified in the makefile. The makefile must be modified to enable parallel 
execution of the code (see below).

\item After the SYMPHONY library is compiled, you are free to type ``{\tt make
        clean}'' if you want to save disk space. You should only have to
        remake the library if you change something in \BB's internal files. To
        clean the user files, type ``{\tt make
        clean\_user}''.

\item To test SYMPHONY, a sample MPS file called \texttt{test.mps} is included 
with the distribution. To specify the file name, use the "-F" command-line
option, i.e., type ``\texttt{bin.$(ARCH)/$(LP\_SOLVER)/mip -F test.mps} in the
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory. To obtain more MPS data files for further
testing, download the MIPLIB library.

\item That's it! Now you are ready to develop your own application by modifying
the files in the \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory and it's
subdirectories. See the user manual for help.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compiling the Shared Memory Version.}

\begin{itemize}
        \item To compile a shared memory version, obtain an OpenMP
        compliant compiler, such as \htmladdnormallink{Omni}
        {http://phase.etl.go.jp/Omni/}
\begin{latexonly} 
        (free from {\tt http://phase.etl.go.jp/Omni})
\end{latexonly}. 
        Other options are listed at \htmladdnormallink{the OpenMP Web
        site}{http://www.openmp.org}
\begin{latexonly}
        ({\tt http://www.openmp.org})
\end{latexonly}.

        \item Follow the instructions above for configuring the makefile. Set
the variable {\tt CC} to the compiler name in the makefile and compile as
above. Note that if you have previously compiled the sequential version, then
you should first type ``{\tt make clean\_all}'', as this version uses the same
directories.  With one thread allowed, it should run exactly the same as the
sequential version so there is no need to compile both versions.

        \item Voila, you have a shared memory parallel solver. As above, to
test SYMPHONY, a sample MPS file called \texttt{test.mps} is included with the
distribution. To specify the file name, use the "-F" command-line option,
i.e., type ``\texttt{bin.$(ARCH)/$(LP\_SOLVER)/mip -F test.mps} in the
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory. To obtain more MPS data files for further
testing, download the MIPLIB library.

\item That's it! Now you are ready to develop your own application by modifying
the files in the \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory and it's
subdirectories. See the user manual for help.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Compiling the Distributed Version.}

\begin{itemize}
        \item If you wish to compile a distributed version of the code, obtain
and install the {\em \htmladdnormallink{Parallel Virtual
Machine}{http://www.csm.ornl.gov/pvm/}} (PVM) software, available for free
from Oak Ridge National Laboratories
\begin{latexonly}
        at {\tt http://www.ccs.ornl.gov/pvm/}
\end{latexonly}. 
        See Section \ref{PVM} for more notes on using PVM.
        
        \item In the makefile, be sure to set the {\tt COMM\_PROTOCOL}
        variable to {\tt PVM}. Also, change one or more of {\tt
        COMPILE\_IN\_TM}, {\tt COMPILE\_IN\_LP}, {\tt COMPILE\_IN\_CG}, and
        {\tt COMPILE\_IN\_CP}, to {\tt FALSE}, or you will end up with the
        sequential version. Various combinations of these variables will give
        you different configurations and different executables. See Section
        \ref{configuration} for more info on setting them. Also, be sure to
        set the path variables in the makefile appropriately so that make can
        find the PVM library.

        \item Type ``{\tt make}'' in the \texttt{SYMPHPONY-4.0/USER} directory to
        make the distributed libraries. As in Step 1 of the sequential
        version, you may type ``{\tt make clean}'' after making the
        library. It should not have to remade again unless you modify
        \BB's internal files.

        \item After the \BB\ libraries, user code will be compiled and
        required executables linked.

        \item Make sure there are links from your
        \texttt{\$PVM\_ROOT/bin/\$PVM\_ARCH/} directory to each of the
        executables in the
        \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/bin.\$(ARCH)/\$(LP\_SOLVER)} directory. 
	This is required by PVM.

        \item Start the PVM daemon by typing ``{\tt pvm}'' on the command line
        and then typing ``{\tt quit}''.

        \item As above, test SYMPHONY using the sample MPS file called
        \texttt{test.mps} is included with the distribution. To specify the
        file name, use the "-F" command-line option, i.e., type
        ``\texttt{bin.$(ARCH)/$(LP\_SOLVER)/mip -F test.mps} in the
        \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER} directory. To obtain more MPS data files
        for further testing, download the MIPLIB library.

\end{itemize}

\noindent This should result in the successful compilation of the sample
application. Once you have accomplished this much, you are well on
your way to having an application of your own. Don't be daunted by the
seemingly endless list of user function that you are about to
encounter. Most of them are optional or have default options. If you
get lost, consult the source code for the sample application to see
how it's done.

\subsection{Compiling the Sample Application with Microsoft Windows}
\label{getting_started_windows}

Here is a sketch outline of how to compile SYMPHONY in Microsoft Windows. This
is the same information contained in the README file that comes with the
distribution. Direct support is provided for compilation under MS Visual
Studio 6.0. Compilation for other compilers should also be possible. Note that
the windows version has some limitations. Detailed timing information is not
currently provided.  Support is only provided for running in sequential mode
at this time.

\begin{itemize}

\item Download {\tt SYMPHONY-4.0.zip} and unzip the archive. This will
create a subdirectory called {\tt SYMPHONY-4.0$\backslash$} containing all 
the source files.

\item In MS Visual C++ 6.0, open the workspace 
{\tt SYMPHONY-4.0$\backslash$USER$\backslash$WIN32$\backslash$user.dsw}.  Note
that there are two projects, one called ``{\tt symphony}'' and one called
``{\tt user}''.  The symphony project contains the source code needed to build
the internal library. The user project compiles a separate library containing
the user-defined functions that can be used to customize the solver.

\item By default, SYMPHONY is set up to use the OSI CPLEX interface with the COIN
libraries installed in a folder called ``\texttt{C:$\backslash$COIN}'' and CPLEX
installed in a folder called
``\texttt{C:$\backslash$ILOG$\backslash$CPLEX81}''. To use a different LP
solver or to specify a different location for OSI or CPLEX, there are a number
of changes that need to be made.

\begin{itemize}

\item You must specify the name of and path to the library to be linked. Do 
this by right-clicking on the symphony project and choosing ``Add Files to
Project...'' Then locate the library file for the LP solver you are using, as
well as the OSI library (if you are using OSI). If you switch, make sure to
delete the old library dependency.

\item You must set the include path for the solver header files. Do this
by right-clicking on the symphony project and choosing ``Settings...'' Then
choose the ``C/C++'' tab, and choose the category ``Preprocessor'' on the
drop-down menu.  Edit the path in the ``Additional include directories'' 
window.

\item You must set the compiler defines so that the right LP solver interface
will be used. Follow the procedure above to get to the preprocessor settings
and edit the ``Preprocessor definitions.'' Make sure that {\tt \_\_OSL\_\_} is
defined if you are using OSL or {\tt \_\_CPLEX\_\_} is defined if you are
using CPLEX. If you are using an OSI interface, then the proper define is
\texttt{\_\_OSI\_xxx\_\_}, where "xxx" specifies the desired solver. For
example, to specify OSL with the OSI interface, the proper define is
\texttt{\_\_OSI\_OSL\_\_}. DO NOT CHANGE COMPILER DEFINES NOT RELATED TO THE LP
SOLVER. Important note for OSL users: When using OSL in Windows, you must also
add \texttt{OSLMSDLL} to the list of definitions.

\item By default, SYMPHONY is also set up to use the COIN CGL library for
generating cuts. If you have not installed CGL, delete the define
``\texttt{ADD\_CGL\_CUTS}'' from the list.


\end{itemize}

\item Note that there are a number of additional compiler defines that control
the functionality of SYMPHONY. These defines are described in {\tt
SYMPHONY-4.0$\backslash$Makefile}, a Unix-style makefile included with the
distribution. To enable the functionality associated with a particular
compiler define, simply add it to the list of defines under the preprocessor
settings, as above.

\item You must also be sure to have any ``.dll'' files required for your LP 
solver to be in your search path. Either move the required .dll to the
directory containing symphony.exe or add the path to the ``{\tt PATH}''
Windows environment variable.

\item Once you have the proper settings for your LP solver, choose "Build
symphony.exe" from the ``Build'' menu. This should successfully build the
executable.

\item To test the executable, right click on the symphony project, go to the
``Debug'' tab and set the Program arguments to ``{\tt -F
SYMPHONY-4.0$\backslash$USER$\backslash$test.mps}'' Note that command-line
switches are Unix-style. 

\item Now choose ``Execute'' from the ``Build'' menu and the solver should 
solve the sample VRP file.

\item Note that there is some functionality missing from the Windows
version. Most prominently, the timing functions do not work. I suppose this
functionality should be easy to add. In addition, the Windows
version will only run in sequential mode for a variety of reasons. However, it
should be relatively easy to get it running in parallel if you can get PVM
working under Windows.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Customizing SYMPHONY}

\subsubsection{Unix}

Developing a simple branch and bound solver that can read in instance data in
a custom format is straightforward using the template provided in the
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/} directory. The simplest approach is to develop a 
sequential application, sharing a single user data structure among all the
modules. Using this approach, an application can be developed by filling in
only a few simple functions. Here are four steps to make the most common
custom modifications.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Decide what run-time parameters you might need and what data has 
to be stored to describe your instance. Edit the file
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/include/user.h}, adding the appropriate fields to the
\texttt{user\_parameter} and \texttt{user\_problem} structure to store the
relevant values.

\item Now edit the file \texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0/USER/Master/user\_master.c}. Only two
function needs to be filled out initially in order to read in . The function
\texttt{user\_io()} is where you can read in the instance data, if it is in
something other than MPS format (a TSPLIB file, for example. Note that the
name of the file to read the instance data from can be specified on the
command line using the "-F" option by default. Also, you'll probably need to
modify the \texttt{user\_initialize\_root\_node()} function to set up the root
node. 

\item Edit the file \texttt{USER/LP/user\_lp.c}. The function
\hyperref{{\tt user\_create\_subproblem()}} {{\tt user\_create\_subproblem()} (see
Section }{)}{user_create_subproblem} must be filled out. This is the most
important function, as it sets up the initial LP relaxation in each search
node.

\item You may also want to add some problem-specific cutting planes by modifying
the \texttt{user\_find\_cuts()} function.

\end{enumerate}

Now compile by by typing ``\texttt{make}'' (assuming that the make
file has already been modified appropriately). That's it! You should now have
a working branch and bound solver. Next you can work on filling in more
advanced functions and adding cutting planes.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Windows}
Developing a simple branch and bound solver that can read in instance data in
a custom format is straightforward using the template provided in the
\texttt{SYMPHONY-4.0$\backslash$USER$\backslash$} directory. The simplest approach is to develop a
sequential application, sharing a single user data structure among all the
modules. Using this approach, an application can be developed by filling in
only a few simple functions. Here are some steps to make the most common
custom modifications.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Decide what run-time parameters you might need and what data has 
to be stored to describe your instance. Edit the file
\texttt{USER$\backslash$include$\backslash$user.h}, adding the appropriate
fields to the \texttt{user\_parameter} and \texttt{user\_problem} structure to
store the relevant values.

\item Now edit the file
\texttt{USER$\backslash$Master$\backslash$user\_master.c}. Only two
function needs to be filled out initially in order to read in . The function
\texttt{user\_io()} is where you can read in the instance data, if it is in
something other than MPS format (a TSPLIB file, for example. Note that the
name of the file to read the instance data from can be specified on the
command line using the "-F" option by default. Also, you'll probably need to
modify the \texttt{user\_initialize\_root\_node()} function to set up the root
node. 

\item Edit the file \texttt{USER$\backslash$LP$\backslash$user\_lp.c}. The
function \hyperref{{\tt user\_create\_subproblem()}} {{\tt
user\_create\_subproblem()} (see Section }{)}{user_create_subproblem} must be
filled out. This is the most important function, as it sets up the initial LP
relaxation in each search node.

\item You may also want to add some problem-specific cutting planes by modifying
the \texttt{user\_find\_cuts()} function.

\end{enumerate}

Now build again and you have a working branch and bound solver! Next you can
work on filling in more advanced functions and adding cutting planes. See the
documentation for more information on this.

\subsection{Sample Applications}

There are now a number of sample applications available as examples of how
to do development with SYMPHONY. These include solvers for the matching
problem, the set partitioning problem (simple and advanced versions), the 
vehicle routing and traveling salesman problems, and the mixed postman
problem. These applications are distributed as separate packages and can be
downloaded 	      
\emph{\htmladdnormallink{here}{http://www.branchandcut.org/SYMPHONY/}}
\begin{latexonly} 
from \texttt{http://www.branchandcut.org/SYMPHONY}
\end{latexonly}. There is also a white paper that guides the
user through the development of the matching solver.
