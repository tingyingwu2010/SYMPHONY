Before release:

1. Update references (make Bibtex file).
2. Update Walkthrough document.
3. Update Web page.
4. Add BEST_FIRST_SEARCH, DEPTH_FIRST_SEARCH methods
5. Make sure setting the node limit to -1 works.
6. Add description of new parameteres to manual.

Notes from addition of sensitivity analysis:

2. Switch how changes to the description are tracked to a bit array in
MIPDESC.

3. Move more functions from master.c to master_func.c

4. Remove the SensAnalysis comments

5. Change FIX_ME to FIXME

6. Switch initial_solve() to call branchAndBound().

7. Make parse_command_line() call set_param() instead of setting internally.

Other TODOs for 5.0

Change "problem" to "sym_environment" everywhere.

Change "symphony_api.h" to "sym_api.h"

Tree trimming before resolving?

Implement resolve as an IP resolve routine, not LP.

Implement cut pool warm starting and saving.

==============================================================================

--Fix up VRP cut generation: the way cuts are allocated and duplicates are
checked for is kind of funny.  

--Fix up cut generation so that all cuts, when generated in sequential mode go
to a local pool (i.e., call cg_send_cut) and then in receiving the cuts, they
get unpacked as a single group. This simplifies things a bit.

--Fix return codes for user functions

--Add send_explicit_cut function

--Document create_explicit_cut and send_explicit_cut

--Document is_int

--Document lp_desc data structure
 
============================================================

1. Switch to all user mains
2. Set granularity in VRP solver
3. Need following functions
   get,set upper bound
   get,set parameters
4. Put problem pointer as part of OsiSymSolverInterface and put users paroblem
data as the ApplicationData_.
5. Need a way to add cut pools and cut generators.
6. Need a load problem method for handing in full problem.
7. A way to display statistics and print solutions.
8. Change name of "problem" to "symphony_environment"
9. Get rid of all the "get_**_ptr()" calls.
10. Make parse command line a separate function.
11. Implement gap limit
12. Implement node limit
13. Implement first feasible solution
14. Permanently combine treemanager and master?
15. Return rootnode and tree to master process?
