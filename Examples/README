*                         SYMPHONY Examples                                  * 
******************************************************************************

These examples are intended to illustrate the usage of SYMPHONY as a callable
library and are taken from the mini-tutorial on the SYMPHONY Callable Library 
for MILP which can be found here: 

http://www.lehigh.edu/~tkr2/research/talks/SYMPHONY-TUTORIAL-ICS05.pdf

Current examples repository includes: 

milp         : implementation of a basic MILP solver
warm_start1  : usage of warm starting capability on parameter modification
warm_start2  : usage of warm starting capability on problem modification
bicriteria   : implementation of SYMPHONY's ability to solve bicriteria 
               optimization problems
sensitivity  : usage of basic sensitivity analysis features

First, modify the configuration file, SYMPHONY/config, to reflect your
environment. Set the SYMPHONY root directory in the Makefile.  Typing "make" 
should successfully make the executables. If you need to install a 
specific example only, add the name of that example as a make command line 
argument, i.e., for instance, type "make milp".
